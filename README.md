# Design-1---Project-2-Counter-

Design and program a microcontroller to produce a system that counts up and down from 0 to 99
using two SPST pushbuttons and two Seven-segment displays. If the count is 99 and the count up
button is pressed, the count will reset to 0 and If the count is 0 and the count down button is
pressed, the count will reset to 99. The value displayed on the two seven-segment displays are to be
multiplexed representing the tens and units values.
